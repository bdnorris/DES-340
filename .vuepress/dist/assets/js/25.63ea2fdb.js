For example, let’s say we have an online store, I would say that\nthe image of the products are part of the content of the website, as our\ncustomers would expect to see what they’re buying, whereas a pattern\non the header of the site isn’t part of the content, but would be part of\nthe design. If we redesigned the site in a year, I doubt customers would\nrequire it before they made a purchase.\nAnother way to think about this issue would be to consider if you’d\nwant the images to appear in a Google image search. Google will look\nat the "),n("img"),e._v(" tags on your website because they’re content of your\nsite, but not at the background images in the CSS because they’re not\ncontent.\nAgain, there’s no right or wrong answer to this. Remember that HTML\nand CSS are design tools, it’s up to the author how they use them.\nWhatever works best for you is the real answer.")])])},[],!1,null,null,null);a.options.__file="images.md";t.default=a.exports}}]);
