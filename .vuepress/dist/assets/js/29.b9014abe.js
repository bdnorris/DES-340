HTML started getting more complicated as more hacks were added, to the point where HTML started to look unusable to normal people.\nNow, remember that HTML was made so regular folks could write it. The people that were making and updating the web browsers at the time decided enough was enough. They needed a new way to Make Coding Great Again, something for the people.\nBack at CERN, one of Tim Berners-Lee’s colleagues, a Norwegian called Håkon Wiem Lie, had an idea based on other word processing programs. The idea that if you were using a header or a paragraph in several places across a website, you probably want them to lookconsistent. The idea that you could make the colors and typography\nconsistent until you wanted to overwrite something later on.\nHåkon had come up with the idea of Cascading Style Sheets (or CSS\nfor short).\nThe cascading part of CSS is the idea that you begin to style your site on\na general basis, then get more particular as you get into the nitty-gritty.\nFor instance, you might want to make the typeface Arial across the\nwhole site, except for headers where you prefer Georgia.\nSo it’s always good to keep this in mind. Start off thinking about styling\nin the most generic way possible. What is the most used color? What is\nthe most used typeface?")])])},[],!1,null,null,null);n.options.__file="selectors.md";t.default=n.exports}}]);
