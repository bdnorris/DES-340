# Project 1A: Intro to Digital Typography

## Web Typography Exploration

### Points: 50

Many websites and on-screen applications are made up of reusable components of text, images and user interface elements (i.e. buttons). These components often need to be flexible, since there might be a lot of variation in the actual content they display. For instance, think about a Facebook post or an article summary on a news website.

Effective digital design needs to be scannable and clearly direct the user to the content most relevant to them. Often, for business purposes, it needs to drive the user toward a specific action.

## Objectives

- Create a one-page website with a visual/textual narrative with a beginning, middle, and end, using:
- Text
- Images

## Examples:

*   [Compstak](https://compstak.com/exchange)
*   [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com)
*   [BackBlaze](https://www.backblaze.com)
*   [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)
*   [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com)

## Objectives

*   Practice studying existing websites for effective methods and patterns of layout, design and user interface
*   Introduction to designing user-interfaces/web layouts in Photoshop/Illustrator
*   Introduction to designing typographic hierarchies for the screen
*   Introduction to considerations of screen size in your designs

## Responsive

Your design should be “responsive”. The simplest requirement here, is that the content should be accessible on a mobile device, as well as a desktop computer. It does not mean that the site looks the same on all devices, just that the content is there regardless of device. We’ll go over a lot more of these details in class.
