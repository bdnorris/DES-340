# Project 1A: Intro to Digital Typography

## Web Typography Exploration

### Points: 50

Often, we'll be discussing in class how web design is different than print. However, one thing that designing for screens and print have in common is that typography is often the cornerstone of a successful design. There are differences in the details, but the foundational concepts are still the same. 

We'll start this multi-part project by focusing on good typographic hierarchy by designing a post for a blog.

## Responsive

Your design should be “responsive”. The simplest requirement here, is that the content should be accessible on a mobile device, as well as a desktop computer. It does not mean that the site looks the same on all devices, just that the content is there regardless of device. We’ll go over a lot more of these details in class.
