# Coding project

## Project 1 or 5

# A5: Single Page HTML/CSS Practice

Points: 50

Presentation style, one group.

## Objectives

*   Apply the HTML/CSS skills you have been learning.
*   Practice the complexities of layout with CSS to better inform your web design decisions.
*   Practice extracting web assets from PSDs.
*   Learning to setup a hosting server and publish your site online.

You will randomly be assigned a PSD file of a web layout representing a desktop view. Your task will be to extract the appropriate assets from this file and layout a single web page in the format of an HTML file with an accompanying CSS stylesheet and all necessary images.

*   Text should be LIVE text (not represented by images).
*   Links should be created but can point to “#”. For example: `[link](#)`
*   The use of “Retina” graphics and SVG images are a plus.
*   Intelligent use of the CSS cascade will be part of your grade.
*   You will also upload the final files to your own hosting account.

## An Exercise

<!-- To get us started on this assignment, I would like you to do a little research. Find a small component or area on a website (any website, but you could consult our “[curated sources](resources.html)” list), screenshot it, and send me the link via Slack. I will do my best, as a presentation in-class, to inspect and describe how it's built. We want to focus on layout here. Not complex interactions or animations. Find an example where you want to know how the underlying HTML/CSS work to position the elements appropriately. -->

## Where to Start

Here’s some resources to get you started.

Since you’re paying for CodeSchool, you should check out [this CodeSchool “Project”](https://www.codeschool.com/projects/build-a-portfolio-using-html-and-css).

You can follow along, or just watch this video. It walks through the process of creating a basic HTML/CSS webpage. You can download a compressed version from if you want to keep it for later: [http://briannorris.io/msuweb/codeschool_1456sm.mp4](http://briannorris.io/msuweb/codeschool_1456sm.mp4)

### Helpful Links

**Before you start:**

[http://learnlayout.com/](http://learnlayout.com/) is a pretty quick 19 page runthrough of how CSS Layout works. I’ll be giving a lecture on these items, and have discussed them some, but the concepts here are fundamental and necessary to learn how to lay out a page.

These are great resources if you’re trying to remember how to do something in HTML or CSS.  
[http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css)  
[https://thecssworkshop.com/css-basics](https://thecssworkshop.com/css-basics)

These are good trustworthy resources, especially for syntax (the exact code you need to write).

### Planning Your Layout

I recommend you start this project by reviewing the above links, and then, printing out a black and white version of your assigned PSD. Then, take a red pen or marker, and start planning out your “block level elements” and how it will fit together.

Feel free to get started by using [HTML Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/), or even starting in [Thimble](https://thimble.mozilla.org/en-US/). We will have a very important lecture on code editors as well.

If you feel like you’d rather wait for that lecture to begin coding, you can also prepare by going ahead and start graphic extraction (PNG, JPG, maybe even SVG).

## Domain Names and Hosting

This will be part of an in-class exercise. You should work on this assignment off of your computer/jump drive/etc. until you have your hosting account in-place.

## Design Notes

Feel free to customize text, images, or even colors if you prefer. But stick to the layout you’ve been given.

You will not need to make this site “responsive” or work on mobile. For your first attempt at web layout, it’s probably best to stick to pixels on your main containers, but you can use percentages or EMs on the children of your main containers.

Larger monitors should be considered though. Decide if the design you have been given would look better with it’s main content areas background infinitely extending to the left and right, or if they should stop, and there should be a separate background.

Ideally, you will center the design you’ve been given in the browser window.

## Grading

Since this project is a little different, you can use the following as a guide to the grade determiners on this project:

*   **Constructive Use of Time**: No change.
*   **Problem Solving**: I’ll specifically be looking at how you used code to solve the layout “puzzle”.
*   **Creativity**: I’ll be looking for any creative solutions you implemented, and more specifically, how well you used the _Cascading_ part of CSS to effectively implement the layout.
*   **Participation**: No change, participating in critique and general participation in class. Presentations will need to be given quickly, so how much feedback you give during other students presentation won’t necessarily be considered.
*   **Presentation**: Clean code with no errors (missing images, incorrect paddings/margins/type sizes etc.) will figure into this, as well as successfully publishing your site to the internet.
*   **Comprehension**: I’ll be using your statement, your communication with me in class, as well as your class presentation to judge your comprehension.
*   **Final Outcome**: Overall, how close did you get to implementing your given layout.

## Presentation

Place your web page on your new hosting account.

You are also required to write a short summary (150–200 words) on your findings from this assignment, with emphasis on any insights you gained by using HTML and CSS on a real project. Place this as an additional text note on your InVision Board.

*   Make a section on your InVision board called Assignment 5.
*   Arrange your summary in an InVision text note.
*   Paste the link to your live site in an additional InVision text note.
