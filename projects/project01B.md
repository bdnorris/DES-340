# Project 1B: Digital Typography: Mastheads and Callouts??

## Web Typography Exploration

### Points: 50

One of the most important parts of a website’s layout is the masthead, and this is especially true on consumer facing sites. It’s the first thing people see when visiting your site and sets the tone for the whole site. It’s also the best place to sum up what your site is about with a tagline or welcome message. You can let the visitor know that they are in the right place, and what the primary value of the site is.

It’s also a common place to feature the company or organization’s logo and, often, the primary navigation that will be repeated on every page of your site.

Your masthead should answer the questions: Where am I?, What can I do here?

Objectives
Further practice studying existing websites for effective methods and patterns of layout, design and user interface.
Further practice designing user-interfaces/web layouts in Photoshop/Illustrator.
Applying the design of typographic hierarchies for the screen to some more specific content.
Screenshots/Research
Look at the provided PSD (ctrl-click, download linked file).
Screenshot the top headers of three websites that have a similar layout. The websites you choose should be from a curated source.
Also take screenshots of 10 buttons/links/click-throughs on the websites you chose.


Part 2: Graphic 1
Use the provided PSD.

Replace the background photograph with a photo or illustration of yours or one you have rights to. The photo should be at least 1600 pixels wide originally so that you don't have to scale it up. The new photo should be either primarily dark (like the one currently in the PSD) or primarily light. It should also have an area (where your text will go) that isn't busy.

Fonts are up to you this time, but you should stick to fonts available on Google Fonts, or Squirrel Fonts.

This updated photo and the content it contains will be called the masthead.

Inside the masthead, add this content:
The top-level headline of the page
Headline Copy: You deserve software that's as low maintenance as you are.
Alternatives: You may change this copy, but it needs to be a 'you' statement directed at the viewer.
You deserve [ a thing ] that is [ positive benefit ]
Example: You deserve an illustrator that works as hard as you do. You deserve a sales force that loves your product as much as you do. You deserve a dating app that can find your [lost half, soul mate].
A button or link (Call-to-action)
Copy: Get Started Now
Alternatives: You may change this copy, but it must be an action statement and can't be "Click here" or anything involving the word "click". The action statement should be what you want the user to do. For the dating app, it would be something like "Find them now".
Below the masthead, you need this content:
Secondary Headline
Copy: Spend more time getting things done
Alternatives: If you changed the headline copy, you can change this copy. It should relate to the headline.
Example: (For the dating app) He's waiting: Find him today
Body copy: Below the second headline, insert 2–3 sentences of lorem ipsum.
You can extend the height of the PSD.

Part 3: Graphic 2
Do a second graphic with the new masthead photo and design, and a redesigned secondary headline and body copy. This time, include an icon, isolated image, photo or video with the secondary headline and body copy (not inside the masthead).

Presentation
Add your final graphics to your InVision board.
Make a section for the 3 studies called Assignment 2, Study 1.
Drag the graphics into this section, along with their original screenshots. Set them each to take up half the screen.
Repeat for your other 2 studies.
Make a section called Assignment 2, Graphic 1, above the studies.
Drag your graphic for Graphic 1 into this section.
Do this for each of your graphics.
In InVision, make sure your Assignment and graphics flow so that the newest items are at the top… Assignment 2, Graphic 2 should be on top.
