# A4: Effective User Interface Design

Points: 100

Critique: 2 Groups, separate presentations.

User interface design is evolving rapidly, and making digital devices easier and easier to use. But competition online is fierce, and engaging the user with better user-interface practices can go a long way.

On this assignment, you will practice some contemporary user interface design patterns, and see how they relate to common past solutions.

## Objectives

*   Further practice designing user-interfaces/web layouts in Photoshop/Illustrator
*   Applying the design of typographic hierarchies for the screen to some more specific content.
*   Create examples for discussion on what constitutes good/better user interface design patterns.

1.  Go to [goodui.org](https://www.goodui.org) and look at ideas [2](https://www.goodui.org/#2), [7](https://www.goodui.org/#7), [14](https://www.goodui.org/#14), [17](https://www.goodui.org/#17) and [52](https://www.goodui.org/#52)
2.  Use these examples to make 5 designs, each in multiple formats.

## Grids

For the following designs, I’m providing Illustrator and Photoshop files in the required formats, with a 12-column “grid” for desktop, and a 6-column for mobile. The grids were generated at [gridcalculator.dk](http://gridcalculator.dk/), so if you would like to adjust your grid, you can use that site to make your own Illustrator grids. Photoshop has a new function to create guides on artboards in a similar manner to this site.

## Design Summary

You’ll be designing a series of before and after graphics at different sizes. First you will design the “before” version at a given, typical, desktop size. The before version represents an old, or at least, less thoughtful approach to a user interface problem.

Then, for your after designs, I recommend you try designing them “**Mobile First**”. We’ll also try designing at double size, to ensure hi-res graphics, but, you’ll save the finals at half size. (I will lecture on the ins-and-outs of designing at different scales like this.) Then, when your mobile design is solid, you will create a desktop version of your design, repositioning or resizing elements as necessary. “**Mobile First**” is a design philosophy summed up with this quote:

> The mobile-first approach is a tenet of progressive enhancement. It is the ideology that mobile design, as the hardest, should be done first. Once the mobile design questions are answered, designing for other devices will be easier. What it boils down to is that, the smallest of the designs will have only the essential features, so right away you have designed the heart of your user experience.

Read about the reasoning and the pros and cons of this approach yourself:

## Design 1: Idea #2

[goodui.org/#2](https://www.goodui.org/#2)

### Before Design:

*   960px x 600px
*   No graphic element
*   Headline: Sign up now
*   Copy: 3 sentences of lorem ipsum
*   Button: Call to action button (text up to you)

### After Design (Mobile):

*   A graphic element, decoration, icon, picture or something to create a positive feeling of getting a free month of something.
*   Headline: Your First Month is On Us
*   Copy: 3 sentences of lorem ipsum
*   Button: Call to action button (text up to you)

_Design your mobile version at 750px wide by 1334px tall. Then, when you're finished, save a copy of it at 375px x 667px (the first size is your “retina” version). This smaller, second version is what you will put on your InVision board._

_If you need to add extra pixels to the height of the mobile design, you may._

### After Design (Large):

*   960px x 600px

_Adjust the After Design to be fluid. It should have the same content as the original design, but the position and size of your elements can change._

## Design 2: Idea #7

[goodui.org/#7](https://www.goodui.org/#7)

Create 3 products of your choosing (can be real or made up, but you'll need an image to go with it). I recommend making these products something you're interested in.

### Before Design:

*   960px x 600px
*   Create the 3 products on the page.
*   Each should have an image, a price, a product name, 1 sentence of lorem ipsum (product description) and 1 other piece of data.
*   Give each product the exact same design treatment on the page.

### After Design (Mobile):

Create the design again, but this time, pull one product out, recommend it, and give it special design treatment.

Must include a recommendation statement like "We recommend" or "perfect for you" etc.

_Design your mobile version at 750px wide by 1334px tall. Then, when you're finished, save a copy of it at 375px x 667px (the first size is your “retina” version). This smaller, second version is what you will put on your InVision board._

_If you need to add extra pixels to the height of the mobile design, you may._

### After Design (Large):

*   960px x 600px

_Adjust the After Design to be fluid. It should have the same content as the original design, but the position and size of your elements can change._

## Design 3: Idea #14

[goodui.org/#14](https://www.goodui.org/#14)

Create 3 options for a user to choose from (may be related to one of the above designs) and a sentence leading into the choice (a headline). Make it sound realistic: Don't say: "Do this, do that, Or something else". Realistic means it would say something like "Ready to start your day? Get coffee, get tea, get a smoothie."

### Before Design:

*   960px x 600px
*   Typeset the lead sentence (headline)
*   Design a dropdown below it. It should be an un-opened dropdown with something like "Choose an option"
*   Create a second state of this dropdown. It has been clicked, and is now displaying the 3 options.
*   You can display both states inside the same 960px x 600px space. Alternatively, you can divide the space into 2 images. (For example: Two 480px x 600px images)
*   Remember, you don't need to completely fill the space with the dropdown menu. Small or medium sized elements are fine, and so is negative space.

### After Design (Mobile):

Create the design again, but this time, pull the options out of the drop down, and expose them inside the design, similar to how they are exposed in the goodui.org example.

_Design your mobile version at 750px wide by 1334px tall. Then, when you're finished, save a copy of it at 375px x 667px (the first size is your “retina” version). This smaller, second version is what you will put on your InVision board._

_If you need to add extra pixels to the height of the mobile design, you may._

### After Design (Large):

*   960px x 600px

_Adjust the After Design to be fluid. It should have the same content as the original design, but the position and size of your elements can change._

## Design 4: Idea #17

[goodui.org/#17](https://www.goodui.org/#17)

Create a tabular list of data like on goodui.org. You can use the same content that they have ("Your Invoices" followed by a list of invoices with a price by each). Where they have scribbles, you should have something that sounds real. Maybe related to one of the earlier designs).

### Before Design:

*   960px x 600px
*   Create the table of data with a headline ("Your Invoices") followed by the list of items (the invoices) and their price.
*   Remember, you don't need to completely fill the space with the table. Small or medium sized elements are fine, and so is negative space.

### After Design (Mobile):

Create the design again, but this time, give users the option to pay directly inside the table. Show one of the items (invoices) as having been paid. Show one of them as having been partially paid.

_Design your mobile version at 750px wide by 1334px tall. Then, when you're finished, save a copy of it at 375px x 667px (the first size is your “retina” version). This smaller, second version is what you will put on your InVision board._

_If you need to add extra pixels to the height of the mobile design, you may._

### After Design (Large):

*   960px x 600px

_Adjust the After Design to be fluid. It should have the same content as the original design, but the position and size of your elements can change._

## Design 5: Idea #52

[goodui.org/#52](https://www.goodui.org/#52)

The user has just completed one of the actions that you wanted them to complete in the designs above (they signed up for a free month in Design 1, or purchased the recommended product in Design 2). They are directed to a new screen where you acknowledge they did what you wanted them to do.

### Before Design:

*   960px x 600px
*   Have an acknowledgement statement saying something general like "We got your order!" or "Your free month is on the way!" as your headline.
*   Follow it with 3 sentences of lorem ipsum.
*   Remember, you don't need to completely fill the space with the design. Small or medium sized elements are fine, and so is negative space.

### After Design (Mobile):

*   Create the design again, but this time, thank the user, followed by a "You" statement. Example:  
    Thank you statement: "Thank you for buying [PRODUCT NAME].
*   You Statement: "Your to-do lists are about to get a lot more fun."
*   Then 3 sentences of lorem ipsum
*   Then 2 calls to action (the blue text in goodui.org). Write them to sound realistic.

_Design your mobile version at 750px wide by 1334px tall. Then, when you're finished, save a copy of it at 375px x 667px (the first size is your “retina” version). This smaller, second version is what you will put on your InVision board._

_If you need to add extra pixels to the height of the mobile design, you may._

### After Design (Large):

*   960px x 600px

_Adjust the After Design to be fluid. It should have the same content as the original design, but the position and size of your elements can change._
