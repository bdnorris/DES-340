			<h1 class="a7">A7:1 Website Workflow: Intro + Conceptualization</h1>
			<p class="meta">Points: 0 (No grade/no critique)</p>
		  <!--<p class="meta">Critique: 2 Groups</p>-->

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This assignment will let you practice designing a website from concept to completion. You will create a concept for a new site, make a wireframe, build a prototype, design and code it.</p>


			<h2>Objectives</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Coalesce everything you’ve learned about web design into one full-featured project.</li>
        <li>Work through a simplified version of a modern web design workflow.</li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Concept</h2>
      <p>Step 1 is to come up with a concept for your site.</p>

      <h3>Some Guidelines</h3>
      <p>Your full site concept should consist of at least 6+ pages, although you will not need to design and code all of them. It could be a site consisting of 100s of pages, or just 6. The goal is to aim for something that might have a lot of content, but you’ll only end up showing smaller pieces of it for this project.</p>

      <p>It will depend on your concept, but you will likely need to come up with the entire architecture for the site in an outline format, you will then focus on the three (or so) most important pages.</p>
      <p>So don’t be afraid to think big, the rest of the assignment will only focus on the most important parts.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Don’t be afraid to make your site <strong>interactive or have useful tools</strong>. Even if you can’t code the interactivity, you can still concept it and show the idea in your designs.</li>
        <li>Make your site <strong>useful and informative</strong>. It should have text and image content. You will show a small portion, but the implication is there could be a lot more deeper in the site.</li>
        <li>Pick something you’re passionate about. (You’ll be working on this until the end of the semester, so choose a subject that will keep you engaged.)</li>
        <li>But <strong>don’t make it about yourself</strong>. No portfolio sites.</li>
        <li>It doesn’t have to be a million-dollar idea. Keep in mind the main objective of this project is the workflow itself.</li>
        <li>Come up with a few different ideas to discuss with me so we can pick the one that will fulfill the goals of this project the best.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Define Your Audience</h2>
      <p>Have a specific audience/user in mind (even if the audience doesn’t technically exist, i.e. freelance mutant zombie hunters).</p>

      <h2>User Stories</h2>
      <p>Write down “User Stories”. Define the tasks and paths users might take on your site. For example, “User arrives at site from search engine. Uses navigation to find interesting page. Reads content. Decided to share with friends using sharing function.” or “User arrives at site directly, logs into her account, and posts new content to her profile.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories">This site</a> has some examples.</p>

      <h2>Presentation</h2>
      <p>There will be no critique, you are responsible for having an approved concept to begin work on part two of the assignment on the given due date.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have your idea, in writing.</li>
        <li>Define your audience, in writing. This can be a general description, or a list of specifics.</li>
        <li>We can expand later, but it’s important to have a few to make sure your concept is robust enough to carry through the rest of your project.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>After discussing these items with me you should place them as text notes on your InVision board under the headings:<br>
        “Assignment 7: Part 1: Concept”<br>
        “Assignment 7: Part 1: Audience”<br>
        “Assignment 7: Part 1: User Stories”.

			<h1 class="a7">A7:2 Website Workflow: Information Architecture, Wireframing, and Prototyping</h1>
			<p class="meta">Points: 50</p>
		  <p class="meta">Critique: 4 Groups</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Step 2 of assignment seven will consist of two parts. Planning the architecture of all the pages of your site, and creating a “low-fi” digital sketch of your site called a “wireframe”. The purpose of these exercises is to plan as much as possible and work out any potential issues before jumping into the design and development phase of the project.</p>

			<h2>Objectives</h2>
			<ul>
        <li>Introduction to modern web design workflow.</li>
        <li>Design and analysis of websites and user interfaces.</li>
        <li>Exploration of information architecture concepts.</li>
        <li>Introduction to “wireframing”/low-fidelity sketching.</li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Information Architecture and “Site Mapping”</h2>
      <p>In Part 1, you were directed to have a certain number of pages in your site. Now it’s time to document those, categorize them into sections, and map out their relationships.</p>

      <blockquote cite="https://alistapart.com/article/flexiblefueleducatingtheclientonia">
        <p>“I often tell clients that Information Architecture (IA) establishes the baseline, or foundation, for a solid site structure. It helps create the traffic patterns and navigational routes that get the customer from A to B in language that is helpful and easy to understand. In fact, IA is the first step in meeting customer goals and can therefore increase brand awareness and product or service sales.”</p>
        <p>—Keith LaFerriere</p>
        <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/flexiblefueleducatingtheclientonia" target="_blank">https://alistapart.com/article/flexiblefueleducatingtheclientonia</a>
      </blockquote>

      <h3>Tasks</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Define your main content</li>
        <li>Decide on which pages those content items will live</li>
        <li>Create a tree-style map of those pages</li>
        <li>Define your navigation areas and what they contain</li>
      </ul>

      <p>They’re typically shown from the top down; where Home and any other common landing pages would be at the top, main section pages underneath (often corresponding to the main navigation), sub-sections underneath that, and so on.</p>

      <h3>Examples</h3>
      <p>
        The most common would be a tree view:<br>
        <a href="http://spot.pcc.edu/~gkerr/general/assets/sitemap-example.jpg" target="_blank">http://spot.pcc.edu/~gkerr/general/assets/sitemap-example.jpg</a><br>
        <a href="https://www.gliffy.com/examples/site-map" target="_blank">https://www.gliffy.com/examples/site-map</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes, a more complex isometric view is useful:<br>
        <a href="http://baynesmedia.com/category/user-experience/information-architecture/" target="_blank">http://baynesmedia.com/category/user-experience/information-architecture/</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        ...whatever is most appropriate for your site.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sitemaps may also share a lot in common with a map of the user flow, corresponding to the user stories you’ve previously written.<br>
        <a href="https://speckyboy.com/collection-inspiring-sitemaps-user-flow-maps/" target="_blank">https://speckyboy.com/collection-inspiring-sitemaps-user-flow-maps/</a>
      </p>

      <p>We’re aiming for a <strong>traditional sitemap</strong> on this project, that <strong>must account for all pages on our site</strong> (large amounts of repetitive pages would be abstracted into a “stack” or some other visual metaphor). Additionally, incorporating some “flow” concepts might be useful, especially if the user flow is particularly complex.</p>

      <h3>Guidelines</h3>
      <p>You can develop your “sitemap” in the style and program of your choosing. I'm providing an Illustrator file to assist you with the “thumbnail” style.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://briannorris.io/msuweb/Thumb_Wireframing_03.ai">Thumb_Wireframing_03.ai</a> (right-click, save download as)<br>
        <a href="http://briannorris.io/msuweb/Thumb_Wireframing_03_leg.ai">Thumb_Wireframing_03_leg.ai</a> (if you have trouble opening the above)
      </p>

      <p><strong>Minimum Requirement</strong> would be a simple document with pages represented by rectangles with a clear hierarchy (levels of content). Dimensions of this document are up to you.</p>

      <h2>“Wireframing:” Planning your most important pages</h2>

      <h3>Examples and Resources</h3>
      <p>Huge list of tips for wireframing, we will only have time to touch on the basics, but this article is a good summary of how far you can take wireframing, especially on a large project that might involve many team members and a large budget.<br>
      <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/11/wireframe-perfectionist-guide/" target="_blank">https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/11/wireframe-perfectionist-guide/</a></p>

      <h3>And also...“Prototyping:” Planning your interactions</h3>
      <p>The methods described here won’t apply, but the “why’s” regarding prototyping do:<br>
      <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/10/the-skeptics-guide-to-low-fidelity-prototyping/" target="_blank">The Skeptics Guide to Low Fidelity Prototyping</a> <span class="important">« Please Read!</span></p>

      <p>Essentially, prototyping might include simply adding clickable links to your wireframes, but often includes interactive items programmed in javascript and animation.</p>
      <p>There are will be <strong>no requirements</strong> for prototyping on this project. I simply want you to explore and have awareness of the possibilities.</p>

      <h3>Tools</h3>
      <p>Choosing a tool for wireframing and prototyping is difficult. It depends a lot on the level of detail you want to establish. Simple thumbnail wireframes can be used to plan the IA and content areas as I’ve mentioned above, and further detail can be achieved with static wireframes consisting of gray boxes and text in Illustrator, Photoshop or Sketch.</p>
      <p>You can also go further with wireframes and create semi-functional mock-ups. We’re going to combine wireframing and some basic prototyping in this project using a tool called <a href="https://webflow.com/" target="_blank">Webflow</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://webflow.com/" target="_blank">Webflow</a> is a full site builder. It can produce production ready pages, and the company has services for hosting and a content management system. Webflow has a few drag and drop <strong>responsive</strong> layout items that can speed up the wireframing process. We’re going to use Webflow to produce our wireframes.</p>
      <p>The free version of Webflow will only allow 2 pages. So we’re going to start there. With my assistance and approval, pick your two most important pages for your site. You’ll develop wireframes in Webflow of these two pages.</p>
      <p>Your wireframe should be visually simple, as in the linked examples. No graphics, photos, etc. Just text and shapes to represent images/buttons/etc.</p>
      <p>Feel free to use Webflow’s built in form fields, linking capabilities, etc. to enhance your wireframes with some basic interactions.</p>

      <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
      <p>The main reason I’m choosing Webflow as the tool for this exercise is it’s great responsive support. You will be able to layout a page, and in real-time, slide the viewport to different widths and see the adjustments happening live.</p>
      <p><strong>You must consider the view, all the way from mobile to desktop for this assignment.</strong></p>

      <h2>User Testing</h2>
      <p>Instead of the typical critique, you will be grouped up with other students to analyze each other wireframes. I will post groups here when ready.</p>
      <p><strong>Your role when looking at another’s wireframes:</strong> Okay, these aren’t real sites, they may or may not clickable, but you should still be able to look at the wireframes, and imagine yourself clicking through. Are there areas that you don’t understand? What happens if you click that button? What does this box represent? Ask lots of questions.</p>
      <p><strong>Your role when you’re showing your wireframe:</strong> Walk your group through your wireframes and sitemap quickly, then let them ask questions. Answer, but pay attention when your answer seems to be need a lot of explanation. It should be obvious what the items on your page are for. If you don’t have an answer, or it takes an inordinate amount of explaining...congrats, you’ve just found an improvement you can make through our facsimile of user testing. </p>
      <p>Collect information from your user testing session, make any necessary adjustments, and make sure you have included the necessary items on your InVision board as noted below.</p>

      <h2>Presentation</h2>

			<p class="meta">Points: 100</p>
		  <p class="meta">Critique: 1 Group</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Part 3 of assignment seven will consist of two steps. Developing “Style Tiles” to define the look and feel of your site, and then coding a “Style Guide” using your knowledge of HTML and CSS.</p>

      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Introduction to modern web design workflow.</li>
        <li>Design and analysis of websites and user interfaces.</li>
        <li>Continuing practice designing user interfaces.</li>
        <li>Continuing to enhance HTML and CSS coding skills.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Style Tiles</h3>
      <p>Instead of designing a full page layout in Photoshop or Illustrator and then attempting to translate this into a coded page, we’re going to approach our final design using the concept of “Style Tiles.” This allows us to efficiently show the look and feel of the site as a whole, rather than focusing on one particular page.</p>

      <p>We’re going to continue to approach this project with the idea that it is a large complex web project, even though we’re only touching bits and pieces. As you can probably imagine, it would be a vast and complex undertaking to design an entire large site by having an Illustrator file for every single page and possible configuration of a site. Instead, developing style tiles, style guides, and wireframes—along with careful art direction—can be an efficient way to get a project up and running. It’s also a great way to begin showing a client work, without too much initial time investment.</p>

      <h3>Tasks</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Research this concept further by reading the following articles on Style Tiles and Atomic Design:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.styletil.es">http://www.styletil.es</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/">http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/</a></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Start creating your style tiles in the program of your choice...you’ll need to define:
          <ul>
            <li>Branding (minimal, don’t focus too much on this, but do give your site a name and type treatment)</li>
            <li>Headings</li>
            <li>Sub-headings</li>
            <li>Body text styles</li>
            <li>Link and/or button styles (&lt;a&gt;)</li>
            <li>A color palette</li>
            <li>Borders, textures, ornaments, etc.</li>
            <li>Any other user interface elements that are central to your site</li>
            <li>Photographic style (natural light/white background/cool/warm/faces/crop styles/etc.)</li>
            <li>Some “mood words” (optional—see reference material)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Presentation</h3>
      <p>You can create more than one style tile if you wish, and each style tile should be 1200px x 900px, landscape. Upload to your InVision board with the section title “<strong>Assignment 7: Style Tiles</strong>”.</p>

      <h3>Style Guide</h3>
      <p>Next, you’re going to create a “Style Guide”, AKA “Pattern Library” using CSS and HTML.</p>

      <p>Start by writing some CSS classes that represent your styles. You will assign actual CSS properties to the different heading and text styles you made, either by assigning to tags like H1, H2, or classes. You will continue by coding borders, some shapes showing your color palettes (with HEX or RGB codes), etc. Basically, translate your style tiles to code, but add more specificity and detail.</p>

      <p>Apply your styles to an HTML file with proper markup. The intent is that when the site is being developed, this HTML and CSS will be used a reference for the rest of the site. A developer making a form would be able to pick the proper button class you defined in your style guide, and the style will be applied automatically.</p>

      <p>Think about STATE. Add hover, selected and disabled versions of buttons if applicable. Any other indicators that would make sense on your site.</p>

      <p>Use media queries for changes for different screen sizes. Minimum of one media query should be used for this project to let me know you understand the concept.</p>

      <p>The goal is to create an HTML document with a healthy selection of elements styled appropriately. When you view some of the reference materials, you’ll notice large corporate style guides can be very large and are often websites in themselves. We’re obviously aiming for something smaller, but here are some guidelines. </p>

      <h4>Must-haves</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>H1–H6 Styles</li>
        <li>Paragraph Styles</li>
        <li>Anchor Styles</li>
        <li>Call to Action Buttons
          <ul>
            <li>Primary</li>
            <li>Secondary</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Form Elements
          <ul>
            <li>Text Input box</li>
            <li>Submit Button</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>A color palette with HEX or RGB codes</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>If Appropriate</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Utility text, for tags, categories, labels, captions, etc.</li>
        <li>Next arrows or arrows for a carousel/slider</li>
        <li>Other UI controls like “X” for close</li>
        <li>Other Form Elements like
          <ul>
            <li>Checkboxes</li>
            <li>Radio (circle) buttons</li>
            <li>Dropdown menus</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Image treatments (borders, shadows, etc.)</li>
        <li>Icons</li>
        <li>Data Tables</li>
        <li>Any other user interface elements that are central to your site</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
      <p>Your style guide should be coded with responsive design principles in mind:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Content should flow naturally</li>
        <li>You should use at least one media query</li>
        <li>Images should be flexible</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Presentation</h3>
      <p>Place the style guide HTML and CSS on your hosting account and place the link as a text node in InVision under the heading “<strong>Assignment 7: Style Guide</strong>”.</p>

      <h3>So, what’s the difference?</h3>
      <p>Style Tiles and Style Guides definitely bleed together. Both show colors, buttons, typography, etc. But there are some differences:</p>

      <h4>Style Tiles</h4>
      <p><strong>Audience</strong>: Although style tiles are great for communicating amongst a design and development team, the ultimate audience for them is the client. They’re meant to quickly get feedback and show possible directions.</p>
      <p><strong>Level of Detail</strong>: Style tiles are general. They exist to communicate mood and the general design direction.</p>

      <h4>Style Guides</h4>
      <p><strong>Audience</strong>: Style guides are to keep everyone on the team, sometimes including individuals outside the organization, from straying too far from the original design intent. </p>
      <p><strong>Level of Detail</strong>: Style guides are specific. They have specifications, like width and height, or exact color codes, etc. </p>
