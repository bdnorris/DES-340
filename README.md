# DES-340 : Web Design for Design Majors

# Introduction

> All materials, whether wood or pixels, have a grain, and that grain suggests the best way to work. Go with the grain and one will find sturdiness combined with tremendous flexibility — a natural and exciting give that grounds decisions and excites with possibilities. Work against the grain and the work becomes precarious, difficult and fragile. Instead of the elegant bending that software requires to adjust to different screens, uses, and situations, the work breaks because it cannot adapt.

— __Frank Chimero__ from the forward of _Learn to Code Now!_ by the __SuperHi Team__

## What are we learning?

### Technical

My goal is to provide a solid introduction to what the web is, how it works, and how to write a basic level of HTML and CSS to get you started.

### Design

I want to highlight and provide an introduction to designing for screens and the web, focusing on all the ways its different from print.
