# E3: Your first website

## Quick and minimal walkthrough of the bones of a website

In class: no points

## The limits of Codepen

As a class, we'll use Codepen a lot. It's super convenient because we don't have to go through all of the setup we normally would to make a site. However, real websites require a lot of setup. We'll get more detailed later, but for this exercise, we will walkthrough the bare minimum's that are required to make a real website that will run on pretty much any computer or server. 

At the end, I'll point you to some base files you can use to get started on in the future, but for now, we'll walk through each piece so you will know what everything does.

## The document : What is HTML anyway?

_HTML_ stands for Hypertext Markup Language. Every `.html` file can be referred to as a document. Hypertext refers to it's linking powers (which is why it's called "The Web"), and Markup refers to the idea that we're taking content (text and images) and "marking it up" with tags. The tags say what that particular piece of content is. A paragraph gets a _P_ tag, a heading gets an _H1_ tag, a sub-heading gets a _H2_ tag, etc. 

We can refer to the HTML file itself as a "document." It becomes clearer if you remember that the beginning of the web was just a network of computers sitting at major universities. HTML was just a language to easily make academic documents with the power of linking them together. Everything that happens on the web is an extension of that initial design.

## What's a browser, and what happens when I put a URL in the address bar?
