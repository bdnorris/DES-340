# E1 HTML Bio

## Your first HTML

We're going to get you started with some basic HTML by making a short bio in codepen.

### Step 1

You've created your [Codepen](https://codepen.io) account right? Login and make a new "pen". 

### Step 2

Add a picture of yourself. You can't upload photos directly to Codepen, so try using [postimage](https://postimg.cc) to upload a modestly sized image of yourself (~200px square) to use. After it's uploaded, copy the "Direct Link".

Start your pen with an IMG tag. It's the tag we use to show images in an HTML Document. It works like:

```{html}
<img width="200" height="200" src="https://i.postimg.cc/XN2Rr5v3/brian-norris-head.png" alt="Brian Norris" />
```
