# E5: Basic Coding Exercise

Points: 20

Now that we've gotten through some lectures and you've been practicing in Codecademy, it's time to try some practical skills by coding a simple text-based design in Codepen.

Download this Illustrator file. It's the beginning text from our Responsive Web Design lecture. Measure the type and set it in Codepen with HTML and CSS.

## HTML

Copy the text into the HTML panel in Codepen and mark it up with the appropriate tags. Since it's Codepen, you don't need to worry about a the `<body>` tag or anything like that, just markup the text. 

## Responsive

Since we haven't talked about responsive coding yet, the only thing expected on this exercise is that your text be contained in a centered container that is flexible, but has a max width to keep the line-length under control. That container should have margins around it on mobile, but grow larger as the screen grows larger.

## Fonts

The font used is Open Sans. You can get it from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). For simplicities sake, just copy this code into Codepen's settings > HTML > "Stuff for `<head>`"

`<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,400i,700,700i" rel="stylesheet">`

## Colors and sizes, etc.

You should be able to the colors and sizes from the the Illustrator file, as well as figure out your margins and paddings.

## Turn in

Name your Codepen "DES-340: Exercise 5". Copy the URL and send to me via Slack.
