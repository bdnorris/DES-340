# E2: UI Study

## "Master Study" of user interface components

Points: 20

Do a study (recreation) of one website masthead/header screenshot, rebuilding the headline, sub-headline, body copy and buttons (the ones that are on the top/header/masthead, not the whole page).
Additionally, do a study of 3 of the buttons you found. 

### Step 1

Screenshot 10 examples of calls to action, highlights, call-outs, or other “components” in web sites (can be from a curated source....)  
Example from wired.com: [https://www.evernote.com/l/ACzF7J2CVXlCSbJH1cFsKC_juYiiTIbZhtw](https://www.evernote.com/l/ACzF7J2CVXlCSbJH1cFsKC_juYiiTIbZhtw)

### Step 2

Choose 3 of them, with instructor guidance, and do a 'study' of them: recreate each of them using Photoshop or Illustrator. You can substitute fonts when necessary.
