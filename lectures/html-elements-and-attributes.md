# HTML Elements and Attributes

## Inline

Question
> This exercise 27 says that <span> elements are used to “separate small pieces of content”. Why would we want to separate small pieces of content?

Answer
> It’s not that we necessarily want to separate content so much as we want to “mark it up” so that we can target it more specifically. There are all kinds of reasons for targeting specific pieces of content. For example, we may wish to use CSS to style the <span> content differently than the other content of a page.


## Block

> It's best to use a <span> element when you want to target a specific piece of content that is inline, or on the same line as other text. If you want to divide your content into blocks, it's better to use a <div>.
