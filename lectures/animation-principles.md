#Why would we to animate anything?
We could probably do an entire post on this topic alone. Oh, wait! Sarah Drasner already did that and her points are both poignant and compelling.

But, to sum things up based on my own experiences:

Animations enhance the way users interact with an interface. For example, smart animations can reduce cognitive load by giving users better context between page transitions.
They can provide clear cues to users, like where we want them to focus attention.
Animations serve as another design pattern in and of themselves, helping users to get emotionally attached to and engage with the interface.
Another benefit of using animations is that they can create a perception that a site or app loads faster than it actually does.
