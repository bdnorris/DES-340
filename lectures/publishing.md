# Publishing a site to the web

## Hosting

To put your site online, you need "hosting." You have to get your site onto a web server. A web server is basically just a computer that is configured to allow HTTP requests from anyone with a browser, and serve up the site's HTML and associated files. 

### Server side languages and databases vs. static sites

A majority of websites on the internet are served by some sort of server side programing language. This can be PHP, Ruby, C#, or even server-side Javascript. The programming around these is often to facilitate retrieving information from a database, then building the HTML dynamically before serving it back to you. 

But in the end, no matter what is happening on the server, it's still just HTML that's being sent to the browser. What you've been learning to build in this class is called a **"static"** site. "Static" here just means the opposite of "dynamic", as in, it doesn't need to be built dynamically by the server, it can just be served as is.
