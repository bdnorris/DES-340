# Prepping, compressing and using Images on the web

>
.jpg JPG files are great for photographs and detailed color
imagery.
.gif Are they called “giffs” or “jiffs”? Who knows... but GIF
files are good for animated images.
.png PNG files are good for flatter color images and if you
have any transparency in your image.
.svg SVG stands for scalable vector graphics which means
they don’t pixelate when really large. Great for icons
and logos.
