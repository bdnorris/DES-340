# Prepping, compressing and using Images on the web

It's a ratio, has inherent height!

Floats.

.jpg JPG files are great for photographs and detailed color
imagery.
.gif Are they called “giffs” or “jiffs”? Who knows... but GIF
files are good for animated images.
.png PNG files are good for flatter color images and if you
have any transparency in your image.
.svg SVG stands for scalable vector graphics which means
they don’t pixelate when really large. Great for icons
and logos.

Where to use HTML <img> tags or CSS
background images?
One question that’s trickier to answer is, what kind of image should we
use when we’re designing our sites? We talked about the <img> tag that
we can use in HTML earlier in the guide, but now we’ve introduced the
background-image in CSS. Which should we use? It depends.
The way that I like to answer the question is to ask: “Does the image
form part of the content of the website, or does it form part of the
design?”. For example, let’s say we have an online store, I would say that
the image of the products are part of the content of the website, as our
customers would expect to see what they’re buying, whereas a pattern
on the header of the site isn’t part of the content, but would be part of
the design. If we redesigned the site in a year, I doubt customers would
require it before they made a purchase.
Another way to think about this issue would be to consider if you’d
want the images to appear in a Google image search. Google will look
at the <img> tags on your website because they’re content of your
site, but not at the background images in the CSS because they’re not
content.
Again, there’s no right or wrong answer to this. Remember that HTML
and CSS are design tools, it’s up to the author how they use them.
Whatever works best for you is the real answer. -->
