# CSS Position, Display and the Box Model

## Box Model

### Margin

### Padding

## The Display Property

> All the tags we’ve talked about so far are kind of bigger boxes of content. Visually they’d go across the whole page and the next tag would go below them. Your header is at the top, then a paragraph below, then another paragraph below that.
These tags are called block tags because they fill the width of the page and make the next tag go beneath them.
Most tags are block tags, but there are other tags where you don’t want to fill up the whole width of the page. For example, you might just want to highlight one or two words in a paragraph.
There are a few tags that can work within a line of text, these are called inline tags.
An example is a bold tag, the `<b>` tag. You might only want to highlight one or two words in the paragraph.

A good rule of thumb is that block tags go down the page and inline tags go across the page.
