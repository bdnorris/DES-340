# CSS Intro and Selectors

> By default, the browser gives them a style that looks like the web would have looked in the late 1980s — a simple white background with black text in a default font. At the time this simple styling was fine for scientific research and basic websites, but as the Web became more popular, the Web’s authors wanted to tweak the look and feel of their sites.

Over a few years between 1989 and 1996, to change the style, authors used plenty of “hacks” — non-standard ways to get around the limitations of the code they could play with. HTML started getting more complicated as more hacks were added, to the point where HTML started to look unusable to normal people.
Now, remember that HTML was made so regular folks could write it. The people that were making and updating the web browsers at the time decided enough was enough. They needed a new way to Make Coding Great Again, something for the people.
Back at CERN, one of Tim Berners-Lee’s colleagues, a Norwegian called Håkon Wiem Lie, had an idea based on other word processing programs. The idea that if you were using a header or a paragraph in several places across a website, you probably want them to lookconsistent. The idea that you could make the colors and typography
consistent until you wanted to overwrite something later on.
Håkon had come up with the idea of Cascading Style Sheets (or CSS
for short).
The cascading part of CSS is the idea that you begin to style your site on
a general basis, then get more particular as you get into the nitty-gritty.
For instance, you might want to make the typeface Arial across the
whole site, except for headers where you prefer Georgia.
So it’s always good to keep this in mind. Start off thinking about styling
in the most generic way possible. What is the most used color? What is
the most used typeface?
