# Introduction

> All materials, whether wood or pixels, have a grain, and that grain suggests the best way to work. Go with the grain and one will find sturdiness combined with tremendous flexibility — a natural and exciting give that grounds decisions and excites with possibilities. Work against the grain and the work becomes precarious, difficult and fragile. Instead of the elegant bending that software requires to adjust to different screens, uses, and situations, the work breaks because it cannot adapt.

## What are we learning?

### Technical Objectives

The goal of this class is to provide a solid introduction into what the web is, how it works, and how to write basic HTML and CSS to get you started. We will discuss higher level concepts in lectures, and through online instruction, exercises and projects you will practice coding in these cornerstone languages of the web.

### Design Objectives

This class will provide an introduction to designing for screens generally, and the web specifically. We'll discuss and put into practice concepts like _Responsive Design_, _User Experience Design_, _User Interface Design_, _Information Architecture_, and typography for the screens and thew web.

### Reasons you might want to learn to code
- Career opportunities
- Not needing to rely on a developer
- You might love it

### Reasons you might not want to learn to code
- You might hate it

### Most importantly: Reasons to learn the basics in this class
#### Communication
To possess a shared language of concepts, terms, and process with developers
#### Understanding
To understand the basics of how large systems (websites) are put together and design for resiliency, and to understand the limits of a particular technology (the web) and design for its strengths and avoid its weaknesses.


> The more interesting question, then – are designers well served to know how to code?

And the answer, obviously, is yes. Any design has constraints. A designer can be more successful by understanding the technological constraints behind whatever medium he or she designs for. An understanding of how certain approaches are "cheap" either in terms of development time or in terms of computational practicality can ensure that a design makes it out of a mockup and into some shipping software.

The best designer is worth nothing if they spend weeks on end creating designs that require, say, some expensive-ass compositing that kills an application's framerate.

Constraints aside, it's great for a developer and designer to share skills because then they can use the same vocabulary. Anything that improves communication is, clearly, going to be a good idea.

And it goes both ways. Developers are well-served to understand design. They know what their code can do, and they know which approaches are resource-efficient. How nice when a developer can suggest a useful design opportunity they already know how to implement.

Design and development are neatly convergent – everyone wins when they understand more of both.

#### Ultimately

If you want to do web design professionally, you will find benefits in learning some (front-end) code, but unless you work for a small firm it is unlikely you’ll have to write anything production ready.
