Design and code intersect
Past everything was fixed width
Solution, keep everything flexible
Code provides tools and techniques

Media queries are the heart
Breakpoints
major ones often for common devices
minor ones where you need them
Min-width and Max-width are the bookends
Percentage and vh VW are the units

clear floats to stack
or let things wrap
showing and hiding with display none and media queries

Work on site: Browser tools for responsive
Navigation
Home Page
Assignment 2 -> Images


Fluid images
	crop, or cover or flexible
	width: 100%
	height: auto
	put in a wrapper, wrapper determines width
	deliver images at max size

Maybe try Bootstrap and Foundation
